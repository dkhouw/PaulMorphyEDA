Title: Scraper and EDA on Paul Morphy's Best Games

Project Description:
  Scraper: I built a scraper in Python from scratch, to scrape all 377 of his games in the games database on chess.com
  Because the structure of this webpage does not indicate who played as white or who played as black, I filtered the games by the color Morphy played, then parsed
  the games into two separate datasets white_games.csv and black_games.csv, so I can pinpoint the player as white and the player as black. I later combined these 
  two datasets into one dataset. 
  
  EDA: For the EDA, I credit https://www.shedloadofcode.com/blog/how-to-scrape-and-analyse-your-chess-com-data/ as a guide on how I structured my analysis.
  This article also has a scraper but I did not refer to it when I built my own scraper.
  
Purpose:
  - To practice my EDA skills; on making graphs, finding trends, asking interesting questions.
  - To build a web scraper from scratch because I've never done so before.

Note: Because these games are 'old' and only takes the best games from Morphy, take my analysis with a grain of salt. This is mainly for practice.
